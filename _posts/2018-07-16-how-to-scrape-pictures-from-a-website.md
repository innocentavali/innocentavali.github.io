## Before making fun

Since I learned some stuff about machine learning, I always want to make use of it and create something fun.

For example, I want to build web applications which can automatically process images. But where can I get the material? 

I don't like the images from some open dataset. It's just...too old...and ugly! 

And sometimes it's also hard to find the specifc component I want. 

So I decided to scrape it from the website myself! Afterwards, I can do whatever I want~ 

## Let's get some popcorns

First let's go to one of my favourite websites with quality pictures - Pinterest.
